We had some really cool izakaya experiences where we mingled with locals, tried dishes we wouldn’t have otherwise, and had an overall great evening.

You can find izakayas all around the country, but here are some famous areas to hop from one izakaya to another:

Tokyo: Yakitori Alley, Memory Lane a.k.a. “Piss Alley”

Osaka: streets just outside of Dotonbori

Osaka: Shinsekai</h4>

<p><i>Good to know: some izakayas charge a “cover fee”, which varies based on the place (we paid on average around 300 yen per person). They might bring a small (aka tiny!) little dish that is supposedly what you’re paying for (as well as your seat).

If you are hesitant about going to an izakaya on your own, Magical Trip offers tours where you can share the experience with a local and other travelers. Oh, and it is quite helpful to be with someone who speaks a bit of Japanese when ordering because many izakayas don’t have English menus.  </i> </p>
