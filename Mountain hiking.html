<p><i>Japan is a great for those looking for outdoor activities. Not only can you find incredible landscapes across Japan’s islands, but there is a culture there of making the most of the surrounding nature. People may already be familiar with the many possibilities for hiking in Japan, but another outdoor sport with lots of opportunities is climbing.

It seems like the sport of rock climbing is having its moment in the limelight right now. Movies like Free Solo and Meru have made a huge impact on people’s interest in climbing and that is sure to only grow now that sport climbing is soon to be an event for the first time ever in the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

Now, Japan may not be generally well-known as a climbing destination, but you’d be surprised just what you can find there. So, whether you’re new to climbing, or super into bouldering, sport climbing or trad climbing, we think you’re going to really enjoy climbing in Japan.</i> </p>
